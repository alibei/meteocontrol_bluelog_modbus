This script can read the remote power control percentage
from the data logger BlueLog XC and switch relays
according to that. It runs on the RPI 2/3/4

If the percentage is 100%, all relays are disabled.
If the percentage is between 99%-60%, relay 1 gets enabled.
If the percentage is between 59%-30%, relay 2 gets enabled.
If the percentage is below 30%, relay 3 gets enabled.
